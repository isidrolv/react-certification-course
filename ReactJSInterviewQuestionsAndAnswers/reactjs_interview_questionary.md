3.- **Question:** Is ReactJS a framework or a library?
a.- A full-stack framework
b.- A frontend framework
c.- A library for building UIs
d.- A database driver

**Answer:** c
**Explanation:** ReactJS is technically a **library**, not a full framework. It focuses mainly on the view layer (UI) in the MVC architecture.

---

4.- **Question:** What are the main features of React?
a.- Virtual DOM, Component-Based, Declarative UI
b.- Routing, Database, ORM
c.- Security, Authentication, Sessions
d.- File System, CLI, Debugging

**Answer:** a
**Explanation:** ReactJS uses a **Virtual DOM** to improve performance, has a **component-based architecture**, and promotes **declarative programming**.

---

5.- **Question:** What is JSX?
a.- A special syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
b.- A backend templating engine for NodeJS.
c.- A JSON parser for React.
d.- A styling language for UI components.

**Answer:** a
**Explanation:** JSX (JavaScript XML) allows developers to write HTML elements directly in JavaScript, making UI code more readable and expressive.

---

6.- **Question:** Why use JSX?
a.- It improves debugging and UI readability.
b.- It runs faster than plain JavaScript.
c.- It allows backend API calls.
d.- It compiles directly to C++.

---

7.- **Question:** Which company maintains ReactJS?
a.- Microsoft
b.- Facebook (Meta)
c.- Oracle
d.- IBM
